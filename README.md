    * **Gear:** Items like tents and backpacks, defined by `model`, `dailyPrice`, `type`, and `capacity`.
    * **Recreational Vehicles:** Motorhomes and caravans, defined by `make`, `model`, `dailyPrice`, `year`, `type`, and `capacity`.
* **Membership Management:** Handle user data for the **Wigell Camping Premium Members Club**, including unique four-digit IDs, names, and membership levels (`Premium`, `Standard`, `Student`).
